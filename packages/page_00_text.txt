This Desktop Application is designed to help you decide what courses (CDCs and Electives) you wish to opt in the upcoming semester.

You can search your desired course, add them to your catalog or even remove them if you want. If you are unhappy with your timetable you can clear all the enteries at once.

To save your work, you can generate the pdf version of your timetable. 

<b>You need to specify the path of the timetable pdf file. </b> 
Click on the folder icon, a window pops up. Select your file and click SELECT. 
When you have verified the path, click on OKAY button. This process may take some time depending on your system, so wait as long as the spinner shows on the window. Then click on NEXT to move onto the main page ...
<b> Hope you like my application. </b>
